# Experiment 11: Classes and Objects in C++

This repository demonstrates the study and implementation of object-oriented programming concepts, specifically classes and objects, in C++.

## Files in the Repository

- **method.cpp**: Defines methods inside the class to demonstrate encapsulation.
- **method_outside.cpp**: Defines methods outside the class to separate declaration and definition.
- **oops.cpp**: Demonstrates basic OOP principles like inheritance and polymorphism.
- **volume_cuboid.cpp**: Calculates the volume of a cuboid using a class.
